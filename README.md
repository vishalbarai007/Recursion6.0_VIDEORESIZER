## AI Models in Action

### **1. YOLO Model (You Only Look Once)**

- **What It Is**: A state-of-the-art real-time object detection system.
- **How It Works**:
  - Divides images into grids and detects objects in a single pass.
  - Predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities efficiently.
- **Use Case in Our Tool**:
  - Detects and tracks faces in videos.
  - Ensures faces remain centered during cropping and resizing.
- **Why Itâ€™s Important**:
  - Enhances video quality by focusing on key elements.
  - Saves time by automating manual cropping tasks.

### **2. Whisper Model**

- **What It Is**: An advanced speech-to-text (STT) model by OpenAI.
- **How It Works**:
  - Uses a transformer-based architecture to transcribe audio into text.
  - Trained on a large dataset, supporting multiple languages and accents.
- **Use Case in Our Tool**:
  - Automatically generates captions from video audio.
  - Improves accessibility and engagement.
- **Why Itâ€™s Important**:
  - Increases video inclusivity.
  - Saves time with automated captioning.
  - Enhances the viewing experience with synchronized captions.
